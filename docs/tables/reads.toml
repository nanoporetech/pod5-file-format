[fields.signal]
type = "list(uint64)"
description = "A list of zero-indexed row numbers in the Signal table. This must be all the rows in the Signal table that have a matching read_id, in order. It functions as an index for the Signal table."

[fields.calibration_scale]
type = "float"
description = "Calibration scale factor used to scale raw ADC data into pA readings."

[fields.read_number]
type = "uint32"
description = "The read number on channel. This is increasing but typically not necessarily consecutive."

[fields.start]
type = "uint64"
description = "How many samples were taken on this channel before the read started (since the data acquisition period began). This can be combined with the sample rate to get a time in seconds for the start of the read relative to the start of data acquisition."

[fields.median_before]
type = "float"
description = "The level of current in the well before this read (typically the open pore level of the well). If the level is not known (eg: due to a mux change), this should be nulled out."

[fields.end_reason_forced]
type = "bool"
description = "True if this read was ended 'forcibly' (eg: mux_change, unblock), false if it was a data-driven read break (signal_positive, signal_negative). This allows simple categorisation even in the presence of new reasons that reading code is unaware of."

[fields.run_info]
type = "dictionary(utf8)"
description = "The run (acquisition) this read came from. Must match the acquisition_id field of exactly one entry in the run_info table."

[fields.num_samples]
type = "uint64"
description = "The full length of the signal for this read in samples (equal to the sum of all 'samples' fields of signal chunks)"

[fields.open_pore_level]
type = "float"
description = "The open pore level for the read. A value value in pA showing the open pore level of the well prior to the read starting. If the information is not available (feature not enabled in MinKNOW, or sequencing run on an old version) this value will be NaN."
